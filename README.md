    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - mysql_db 

**login_unix_socket:** is very important
```
          - name: update mysql root password for all root accounts
            mysql_user:
              name: root
              host: "{{ item }}"
              login_unix_socket: /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
              password: "{{ db_password }}"
              login_user: root
              login_password: "{{ db_password }}"
              check_implicit_admin: yes
              priv: "*.*:ALL,GRANT"
            with_items:
